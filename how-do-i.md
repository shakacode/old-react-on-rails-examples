# How Do I?

Please submit PRs with new questions! Or [email justin@shakacode.com](mailto:justin@shakacode.com). 

## 1. How do I add the Shakacode eslint setup to my project?
1. Add [packages related to eslint in client/package.json](./todo-app-production/client/package.json) as well as the "script" to run "eslint" from the same file.
2. Copy [.eslintrc.yml](./todo-app-production/client/.eslintrc.yml) to your project.

## 2. How do I add the [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) to my project?
[redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) is super useful! Here's an example in the [shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/master/client/app/bundles/comments/store/routerCommentsStore.js#L5). We'll have a newer example on this soon.
